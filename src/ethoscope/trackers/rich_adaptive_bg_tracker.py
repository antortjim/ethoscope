    Extract extra behavioral features inspired by
    https://elifesciences.org/articles/34497
    These features are:
      (1) periphery movement (PM), which characterizes movements of the legs, head and wings.
      (2) core movement (CM), which quantifies movements of the thorax and abdomen.
      (3) centroid displacement (CD), which quantifies whole body displacement.

      (3) Is implemented in the AdaptiveBGModel class as the XYDistance instance,
      however (1) and (2) are not and could potentially be very useful to distinguish
      micromovements like grooming. See figure 1.E from https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6476/440
      for a similar implementation of the same ideas.

      Distinguishing between stillness and micromovements holds the potential power to
      better estimate sleep by not overestimating it,
      thus leading to more accurate behavioral monitoring and thus
      a more accurate representation of the biological phenomena.
